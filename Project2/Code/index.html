                        <div class='step'  data-index='0'><p>Those were the last words of Taichin Preyor, a 44 year old African American male, sentenced to death for murder. 
                                He was executed on July 27th, 2017 in the state of Texas. He was the 1,458th individual to be executed in the United States since 1976. 
                                His last words speak volumes to the immoral act of the death penalty. 
                                How did the modern era of the death penalty come to be and what does it look like today? Is it a fair way of administering justice to those who have wronged? 
                                The following piece looks to answer those questions. 
                                The inspiration, data, and much of the insights come from a great series of articles done by The Intercept. These articles can be found <a href="https://theintercept.com/series/the-condemned/">here</a>. </p>
                                <p>The 1976 Supreme Court ruling of Gregg vs Georgia held that in cases which the individual was convicted of deliberately murdering another, the use of the death penalty may be appropriate IF carefuly employed. 
                                The court had also ruled that the new statutes had contained “objective standards to guide, regularize, and make rationally reviewable the process for imposing the sentence of death”, but as we will see this was
                                far from the truth. Following this ruling, 38 states went ahead and enacted statutes that mirrored the ones upheld by the Gregg vs Georgia decision. This decision introduced the modern era of the death penalty. </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class='step'  data-index='1'><p>The first piece of evidence that one could use to prove that decisions made around death sentencing were not "objective" and "rational" is the following graph. It shows the total # of death sentences issued per year in the United States from 1976 to 2019.
                                As you can see the total number of death sentences issued to individuals has drastically gone down over the years. This downward trend in death sentences is partly due to research that showed the biased, racist, and discriminatory nature of decisions regarding death sentencing, as well as improvements to the quality of capital defense provided for individuals. 
                                At first glance one might believe that this downward trend in sentences is a sign that the death penalty is on its way out, but unfortunately, there are still individual's who are waiting on death row to be executed still, all based on a decision that could have easily been influenced by bias or racist fervor </p></div>
                        <div class='step'  data-index='2'><p>We also cannot talk about the death penalty without mentioning Race. Race has always had a huge effect on who gets sentenced to death or not in this country. The following graph shows the total number of individuals sentenced to death since 1976, by race. 
                                For the majority of the years, the total number of death sentences for individuals of color is less than individuals who were white/caucasian. One might again assume that the situation is improving, but like we saw before, this is not the full story. 
                                If we look at death sentences by state, we see that the death penalty is more racially biased than ever. According to insights gathered by The Intercept, 
                                51% of the individuals sentenced to death in the state of texas from 76'-86' were African American and, in the past ten years that number has grown to larger than 75%.</p></div>
                        <div class='step'  data-index='3'><p>Over the past 40 years, a total of 7328 individuals have been sentenced to death. 3,129 or a stunning 43% of those individuals are not currently on death row, meaning that they were either resentenced, exonerated, released from prison, or died. 
                                Of those 3,129 individuals, 592 of them died while waiting for execution, either of natural causes or of suicide. Those who were resentenced,exonerated, or released from prison represent 39% of the whole sample. In other words, many of the original prosecutions were wrongfully assigned, another sign that proves
                                that none of the original decisions were made objectively or rationally.</p>
                                
                                <p>The packed circle diagram on the right shows the status of others who were sentenced to death and breakdown those numbers by race as well (represented by the red circles) 
                                This only includes individuals in which data was able to be retrieved. It leaves out the countless individuals whose records were lost or just not available. 
                                One of the main lessons learned by The Intercept reporting team while collecting this data, was that death sentencing records are extremely sparse, vague and varied from state to state. 
                                There is a very high chance that this data does not include data on every single death sentence issued since 1976. </p>
                                </div>
                       <!-- <div class='step'  data-index='5'><p>Sankey Diagran</p></div>-->
                        <div class='step'  data-index='4'><p>One would think that a decision as large as sentencing someone to their death, a decision that was thought to be made "objectively" and "rationally", would be carefully thought out, and records impeccably kept. 
                                Reality shows the exact opposite. The fact that over 39% of individuals were assigned incorrect prosecutions shows the many flaws within the death penalty system. 
                                The extreme bias in specific states of sentencing people of color shows the discriminatory nature of the death penalty.</p>
                                <p>These number and graphs can only do so much to show the deep flaws within the death penalty system.
                                                What they fail to do is represent and convey the emotional pain it causes individuals who were wrongfully sentenced. Numbers and graphs fail to convey the pain felt by their loved ones and family members. Those emotions can only be conveyed through words.
                                                So rather than ending with another number or graph, I leave you to read the final words of individuals right before they were executed, to better understand the emotional effects the death penalty has had on these individuals and their family members.</p>

                <p>If you are interested in learning more about what it is like to be on death row
                 you can listen to this great episode of Ear Hustle, a podcast run by the inmates at 
                 San Quentin Prison. <a href="https://www.earhustlesq.com/episodes/2018/5/23/the-row">In this episode</a> three men who are death the-row
                 explain what daily life is like on death row.
                </p>
                <p>Another horrible facet of the death penalty that was not explored here, is the method by which individuals are executed.
                Of these methods, many consider the most contraversial  to be Lethal Injection. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lTczPEG8iI">This episode</a> of Last Week Tonight, with John Oliver, does a great 
                job explaining why this method is so contraversial and downright inhumane.
