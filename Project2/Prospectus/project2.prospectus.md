## 40 Years of the Death Penalty

As I was looking for datasets to use for the narrative project, I came across a great article done by The Intercept. That article done by The Intercept focused on data they had collected for over 40 years of the Death Penalty, an era otherwise referred to as the "Modern Era" of the death penalty. The data contains information on individual death sentences starting from 1976. Each record in the data set contains information about the individuals race, state in which they were convicted, year in which they were sentenced, and their curreent status (still on death row, re-sentenced,not on death row, and executed)

The Intercept article highlighed some very stark trends in the dataset. 
1.  The first being that the number of individuals served the death sentence has decreased drastically over the past four decades. 
2.  The second trend that the article highlighted was that although the number of overall death sentences has decreased over the years, the number of people of color who have been sentenced has gone up since 1976. 
3.  I would also like to see how this has veried from state to state. I know there are some states who have much higher death sentencing rates than others. 
4. And lastly, by examning the current status of each individual who was sentenced over the years, I would like to visualize the number of individuals who have been executed, still on death row, or resentenced. The Intercept article had stated that vast majority of the individuals who were originaly sentenced to death were not currently on death row (i.e. either resentenced from death sentence to a life sentence, or exonerated, or had died while on death row), demonstrating that the system put in place to determine whether or not an individual should receive a death senteces was flawed to begin with. 

Based off the insights mentioned above and that were provided by The Intercept article, I want to provide a visual history of the "Modern Era" of the death penalty. 

Lastly, I personally also strongly disagree with the death penalty. I think its unfair, not effective, racist, and discriminatory. I also think that the exisistence of the death sentence largely mirrors who we are as a society. It shows that we are a society that does not respect life and one that deliberatley kills to solve our social problems. To demonstrate the unethical and immoral nature of the death penalty i want to end by visualizing a dataset that I found that contains the last words of inmates who were on death row.
