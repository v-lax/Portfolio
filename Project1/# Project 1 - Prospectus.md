# Project 1 - Prospectus 

## Title – Every shot from the 2018 NBA playoffs

The project will visualize every shot taken by each player and each team, during the 2018 NBA playoffs. Usually when you watch a basketball game you tend to focus on each play and each shot and you usually don’t get a birds eye view of how the game went down after. You just get a winner and loser. But what if you wanted to see how a specific player did during the game? Where were most of their shots coming from? If I were a coach I would maybe want to know where the opposing team takes the most shots. I would also maybe want to see where on the court they make the least/most amount of shots. 

There are a vast number of questions we can answer by visualizing shot location data, and which question you want to answer really depends on who you are. So before I even answer this question, it makes sense to answer who the intended users of this visualization will be. The intended users of this visualization could be Coaches, Players, or just fans. I’ve listed below questions for each group of potential users.

Coaches – Playoffs are a crazy time and the way teams usually play during the regular season will change during the playoffs. So a coach could visualize this past playoff shot data for an upcoming playoff game to prep his/her team. A coach may want to answer the following questions.
•	Where is the opposing team taking the most shots?
•	Where are they making the most shots? Where are they making the least? 
•	Can we improve our defense in certain places? 

Player – A player would want to answer questions similar to the ones a coach would want to answer. In a way if they are looking at a team or players shot history and location, they can better prepare to stop those shots if they are already know where they are going to occur. Now there is no probability added in but they have a general idea of which direction a team’s/players offense will go.
•	Does the opposing team take a lot of three pointers in transition (switching from defense to offense)?
•	Do specific players a better mid range shooter or three point shooter, or do they score a lot of points near the basket? 

Fan – As a fan, this allows me to see and enjoy the game from a totally different perspective and see how my favorite players/teams are doing. 
•	Where are the majority of the shots my favorite player/team take coming from during all of the playoffs? 
•	Where can my favorite player/team possibly improve their game? 
•	Where/when/who took that buzzer beater shot during game 7? 
•	What was the last shot that ended my team’s playoff hopes? Who took it?  

I plan on using a dataset obtained from Kaggle. It is a dataset that contains shot data from each player and each game during the 2018 NBA finals. That dataset was created by scrapping data from the stats.nba.com website. The website is run by the nba and collects data from each game and each player. 

I will need to do some data cleaning on this dataset, so that I can group data points such as players/teams/specific games/conference together. I need to do that so that I can add filters to my visualization and allow my user to work their way through the playoffs, game by game, team by team and player by player.
