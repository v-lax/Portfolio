                        <div>
                            <p>When you watch a basketball game, you usually only care about one thing at the end of the day,
                                Whether or not one team beats another. For how advanced the game has become, the basic premise of
                                the game is to score more points than the other team, and because of that the outcome boils down to 
                                only two numbers. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But a basketball game is so much more than those two numbers. The beauty and fun of watching the game comes from 
                                seeing beautiful plays being run by teams. It comes from watching a player struggle for the majority of 
                                the game only to hit the game winning shot with two seconds left on the clock. It comes from watching heated
                                battles between strong defenses and elegant offenses, and when the focus lies on just those two numbers, its like watching an
                                grand imax movie through two penny sized pin holes. You miss so much of the story! But what if you could see an entire game all at the same
                                time? What? Is that even possible? 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Nope, its not like that last scene from Interstellar where Matthew McConaughey's charater has access to each moment in his life. But...you can get pretty close by
                                by graphing shot location data on a basketball court. The following interactive visualization project that I have done visualizes every shot(well almost every shot) from
                                the 2018 NBA play offs. You can click on what ever series your interested in seeing and from there you can compare games, players and teams. Go ahead, check it out!

                    </h2>
                    <p> I came across this dataset that contained the "final statements" of individuals on death row right before they were 
                        about to be executed. As I was going through each of the statements one really stuck out to me. It mentioned a quote from
                        Corretta Scott King. The quote goes something like this - "Justice has never advanced by taking a life". It pretty much 
                        summed up the only argument one needs in getting rid of the death penalty. What kind of society are we, if we believe that 
                        the only way for justice to be served is by taking away someones life?  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Even with that simple and powerful argument, why on earth does the Death Penalty still exist? How did the death penalty get to be this horrible?
                            Is it improving or are we still executing individuals? This narrative visualization looks to answer those questions as well as bring to light 
                            all that is wrong with the death penalty.
                        </p>
